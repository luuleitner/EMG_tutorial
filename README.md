This short tutorial is a hands-on introduction to electromyography (EMG) signal processing and analyses. During this exercise, we will explore a single differential EMG's amplitude and spectral features recorded on two biceps brachii contractions. This practical example is part of the Graz University of Technology lecture series Applied Electrophysiology and Sensors. Start the course by opening it in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luuleitner/EMG_tutorial/blob/master/EMG_processing.ipynb).
