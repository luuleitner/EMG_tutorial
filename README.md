This short tutorial is a hands-on introduction to electromyography (EMG) signal processing and analyses. During this exercise, we will explore a single differential EMG's amplitude and spectral features recorded on two biceps brachii contractions. This practical example is part of the Graz University of Technology lecture series *Applied Electrophysiology and Sensors*. Start the course by opening it in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luuleitner/EMG_tutorial/blob/master/EMG_processing.ipynb).
