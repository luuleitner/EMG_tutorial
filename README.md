# EMG_tutorial

This short tutorial is a hands-on introduction to electromyography (EMG) signal processing and analyses. During this exercise, we will explore a single differential EMG's amplitude and spectral features recorded on two biceps brachii contractions. This practical example is part of the Graz University of Technology lecture series Applied Electrophysiology and Sensors.
